#  Role-Based Access Documentation

## Overview
   Role-based access control (RBAC) is implemented to restrict route access based on user roles (Admin or Coach).

## Implementation

## 1. JWT Authentication: Tokens include the user ID and role.
## 2. Auth Middleware (auth.js):
Decodes the JWT token and attaches the user info to the request.
Checks if the userâ€™s role matches the required role(s) for the route.

## 3.Role Permissions:
Admin: Can create, delete, and manage all resources.
Coach: Can only manage resources assigned to them (i.e., their own clients).

# Example Usage in Routes
  Example route for creating a client, accessible only by coaches and admins:

  ## router.post("/clients", auth(["admin", "coach"]), clientController.createClient);
